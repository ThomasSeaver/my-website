									<h3 class="major">Why do this?</h3>
									<p>This app was built for CS 2340, which is a software design class that takes place over the course of a semester. Similar to Georgia Tech's Junior Design program, the first half is software design and paperwork planning, while the second half is actual implementation. This was a difficult project, mostly because none of us had worked together before, none of us had any experience with Android app development, and there was a lot of work that was effectively busy work since such a small implementation doesn't necessarily benefit from all the pre-planning.</p>
									<p>The idea of the app was pretty simple, and all teams had to do the same idea and implementation. Users will be homeless populations, who can open the app, login, view the local shelters, and check the number of available beds with the opportunity to reserve one if available. In theory, this would lessen overcrowding, and utilize under-utilized shelters, and prevent the homeless from wandering from shelter to shelter not knowing whether beds were available.</p>
									<p>The execution is not the prettiest, and the development was a year ago at this point, but ultimately I believe we achieved actual login authentication, live database viewing of beds/shelters, and database updating for reservations. I think we could have done more overall, but we did end up with a functional Android app, which I was happy with at the end of the day, since it was my first attempt. Still have nightmares of Android Studio/Emulators.</p>
