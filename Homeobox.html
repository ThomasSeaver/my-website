									<h3 class="major">Why do this?</h3>
									<p>I'd been interested in Game Jams for a while, I enjoy creating games and doing hackathons and limited time programming events, but I'd never gotten the chance to do one mostly out of too much work and a lack of artistic support. This summer I've been more free, however, so when my sister (who is a pretty good artist) was talking about game development, I asked if she wanted to do something quick like that, and she said sure. </p>
									<p>We ultimately chose the Butterscotch Shenanijam, mostly because it was upcoming and pretty popular, but also because it gave a temporary key to GameMaker Studio 2, which was a software I'd never tried before. Ultimately I did not care for it too much over other free development software like Unity or Unreal, but I enjoyed learning it, and it was much more intuitive for 2D games than Unity is, in my opinion.</p>
									<p>Dr. Homeobox was born out of the "DNA Chaos" theme presented by the jam. The idea comes from the homoeotic mutations that scientists successfully induced in flies, such that they grew legs rather than antennae on their face. In Dr. Homeobox, after accidentally hitting your lab's self destruct button, you must run through your lab after drinking your DNA potion, grabbing your scattered research papers and escaping by successfully utilizing powerups in the form of various animals.</p>
									<p>The end product is less than perfect, buggy, and pretty short, but I think it's a good example of something I consider completed, and something that can be improved on easily.</p>
