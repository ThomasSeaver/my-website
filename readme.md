## My personal website

Hey, this is the repository for my landing page that hosts all my projects and a copy of my resume. 

It's built off a [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net) template, specifically Solid State. It's then hosted on github pages, using a domain from namecheap. 

If you wanna see it, head over to [thomasseaver.me] (https://thomasseaver.me).
