										<h2 class="major">Hi, I'm Thomas</h2>
										<p>I'm an undergraduate computer science student  studying at the Georgia Insitute of Technology. I have a wide variety of skills and experience, ranging from my media & systems architecture specialized education, to my previous jobs where I faced customers, created automated website testsuites and documentation, or even helped build mobile applications for large scale weekly usage by company workers across the United States. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Skills and interests</h2>
										<p>Throughout my educational and professional careers, I have dealt with many different technologies. I have experience in <strong> Javascript, Java, Python, C, C++, </strong> and many different frameworks such as <strong> AngularJS, Vue.js, Node.js, </strong> and others. Though I feel comfortable calling myself a <strong> web developer,</strong> I have also worked with <strong> Arduino systems, Android applications, Discord Bots, Chrome Extensions, </strong>and even <strong>Alexa Tasks.</strong></p>
                                        <p> However, I am always interested in learning new technologies, and a large part of my passion for software development comes from teaching myself new useful systems I come across, and understanding how best to apply them. Beyond my basic drive to self-educate, I am also especially interested in design oriented content, such as games and movies, climate change, and cats. Use this information as you will.</p>
