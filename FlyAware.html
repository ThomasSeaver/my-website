									<h3 class="major">Why do this?</h3>
									<p>This was a project completed as part of Georgia Tech's Junior Design program. The program essentially gets requests for programming projects, from local or remote companies, universities, or organizations, then assigns groups of students to the projects, which they complete over the course of two semesters. The first semester is mainly the planning and paperwork of software design development, while the second semester is actual programmatic and system development, ending up with a completed project by the end of the semester.</p>
									<p>We were originally a team of five, though we lost a member second semester, and were assigned a project requested by Dr. Kim Cobb at the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences college at Georgia Tech. The doctor had recently gotten into tracking her own carbon footprint, and realized how ridiculously large the portion from air travel was. Relatively, she takes part in much more air travel as a research professor at a large technical university than the average person, but what she found is that even one or two transoceanic flights, or just several domestic flights, can quickly overtake the carbon footprint each American generates on average.</p>
									<p>The idea for the app was that it would be a chrome extension that would automatically and non-invasively pick up information about flights during a user's booking process on major airline websites, then deliver an estimate of the carbon footprint generated, contextualize it with conversions from the EPA, (i.e. this is equivalent to charging 3000 cellphones, driving 300 miles), then give the user the opportunity to offset their carbon footprint by donating to local charities that help pull carbon out of the atmosphere.</p>
									<p>We focused on minimal time cost to the user, ease of use, and being fully transparent about how we calculate and break down the generated footprint. This app was built so that any user can learn about their impact, help build local carbon markets, and still fly while feeling good about their personal climate change impact. </p>
									<p>We were ultimately really happy with the final product, and won second place in the Georgia Tech Convergence Innovation Competition that Spring. I think the whole team really worked super hard to get it perfect, and I'd really like to thank Dr. Cobb's associate Lalith Polepeddi, who met with us weekly throughout and definitely helped the project come to a succesful conclusion.</p>
